'''Tic-Tac-Toe

Created for HIT3046 AI for Games, Lab 02,
By Clinton Woodward cwoodward@swin.edu.au

Notes:
* This simple function based implementation does not use an OO design. 
* Each function has a description string -- read to know more.
* Overall game flow follows a standard game loop trinity: 
    - process_input() # from the current player (human/AI)
    - update_mode()   # check the players input, then update the game world
    - render_board()  # draw the current game board
* Global variable (oh no!) are used to store and share game related data.

If you want to create your own AI it is suggested that you:
* Copy the get_ai_move function and rename it.
* Write you own new fancy AI thinking code
* Update the "process_input" function to call your new "get_ai_move" code.


Want OO? There's another version of this code. Same functions, nice class.
